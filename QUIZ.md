Simple JavaScript Quiz
======================

This is a JavaScript exercise for beginners. You should be able to modify this quiz without breaking it. There are two files:

+ quiz.html
+ scripts/quiz.js

Your mission is to add one **new** complete question to the quiz. See if you can add it after the existing question 2 and before the existing question 3. You will need to modify the JavaScript file *as well as* the HTML file.

Do not delete or change any of the four existing questions in the quiz.
